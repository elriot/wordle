# Wordle

Wordle is a game where you guess the word of the day, which is comprised of 5 letters. It works seamlessly on both PC browsers and mobile devices.

**Feature 1:** The word is selected from commonly used 5-letter words.

**Feature 2:** The background colors represent the following:
- Green: The correct alphabet is in the correct position.
- Yellow: The alphabet is in the word but in the wrong position.
- Grey: The alphabet is not in the word.

**Feature 3:**
1) If you guess the word of the day, you can start the game with a new word.
2) You can reset the current board.
3) You can copy the game link to the clipboard to share it with others.
